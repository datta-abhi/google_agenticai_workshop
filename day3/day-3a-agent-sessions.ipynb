This dramatically speeds up the initial stages of drug discovery.\n*   **Predicting Clinical Trial Success:** While still an evolving area, AI is being developed to predict the likelihood of a drug candidate succeeding in clinical trials based on preclinical data and historical trial outcomes.\n\n**4. Advancements in Data Integration and Analysis:**\n\n*   **Multi-modal Data Integration:** AI excels at integrating and finding patterns in diverse data types – from chemical structures and biological assays to patient omics data and scientific literature. This holistic view is crucial for a deeper understanding of disease and drug action.\n*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Literature Mining:** NLP algorithms can sift through millions of scientific papers and patents to extract valuable information about existing research, identify knowledge gaps, and suggest new hypotheses or experimental designs.\n\n**5. Emergence of AI-Driven Biotech Companies:**\n\n*   **Specialized Startups:** A significant trend is the rise of biotech companies specifically built around AI for drug discovery. These companies are leveraging cutting-edge AI techniques as their core technology. Examples include Insilico Medicine, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Exscientia, Atomwise, and BenevolentAI, among many others.\n*   **Partnerships and Acquisitions:** Big Pharma companies are actively partnering with or acquiring these AI-driven biotechs to access their technology and accelerate their own pipelines.\n\n**Examples of Recent Progress:**\n\n*   **AI-designed drugs entering clinical trials:** Several companies have announced that drugs designed entirely or in part by AI have entered human clinical trials for various diseases, including cancer and fibrosis. This is a major milestone, moving AI from a research tool to a clinical reality.\n*   **Accelerated discovery timelines:** Companies are reporting significant reductions in the time it takes to move from initial target identification to a drug candidate ready for preclinical testing, sometimes from years to months.\n\n**Challenges and the Road Ahead:**\n\nWhile incredibly promising, challenges remain:\n\n*   **Experimental Validation:** AI predictions still need rigorous experimental validation in the lab and in clinical trials.\n*   **Data Quality and Access:** The performance of AI heavily relies on the quality, quantity, and accessibility of relevant biological and chemical data.\n*   **Interpretability:** Understanding *why* an AI model makes a certain prediction can still be a challenge, which is important for scientific understanding and regulatory approval.\n*   **Regulatory Pathways:** The regulatory landscape for AI-generated drugs is still evolving.\n\nIn summary, AI is fundamentally changing how drugs are discovered and developed. It's moving from an experimental concept to a practical, powerful tool that is already leading to new drug candidates and has the potential to revolutionize medicine.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **second development** I mentioned, which is:\n\n**AI in Medical Imaging and Diagnostics.**\n\nThis area is also experiencing rapid advancements and has profound implications for how diseases are detected and managed.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
